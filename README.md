# Alloteropsis_semialata_demography

This repository contains the scripts used for data analyses and visualisation in the following paper: 

Sotelo G, Gamboa S, Dunning LT, Christin P-A, Varela S (xxxx). C4 photosynthesis provided an immediate demographic advantage to populations of the grass *Alloteropsis semialata*.

## Niche and demographic analyses (analyses folder)
- Script 00 corresponds to the ecological niche analyses

The remaining scripts correspond to the demographic analyses. The specifications for the demographic models can be found in the subfolders fsc2_templates (for fastsimcoal2 models) and stairwayplot_templates (for Stairway Plot 2 model)

- Scripts 01 to 07 and 15 were used for clade-level analyses
- Scripts 08 to 12 were used for locality-level analyses
- Scripts 13 and 14 were used for both clade- and locality-level analyses
- Scripts 05 and 13, used for fastsimcoal2 analyses, were adapted from additional scripts available at <http://cmpg.unibe.ch/software/fastsimcoal2/>
- Script 15, used for SFS block-bootstrapping, was adapted from that available at <https://speciationgenomics.github.io/fastsimcoal2/>

## Data visualisation (plots folder)
All figures were generated under R version 4.2.2

The figures from the paper that are not included in this folder were done with inkscape (<https://inkscape.org/>)
